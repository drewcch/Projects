# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project implements Tic-Tac-Toe using Java and uses a console input interface that the user interacts with.

This is a single player game that involves the user playing against a AI who will not lose the game, essentially making this implementation of Tic-Tae-Toe unwinnable for the user.
