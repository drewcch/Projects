# Checklists

This is a Checklists project created using Java that allows the user to create various types of lists containing items using a console input interface.

These items can be named and marked complete, with item types corresponding to their list types.

There is an additional graph feature that allows the user to see the frequency of item completion using an external Java graphing library.
